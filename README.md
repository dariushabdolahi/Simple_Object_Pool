## Lessons Learned

What is Object Pooling?

Imagine a box of tools Instead of creating a new tool every time you need one (which takes time and resources), you have a box of pre-made tools ready to be used. When you need a tool, you grab it from the box. When you're done, you return it for someone else to use later.

Objects are your tools In programming, objects can be expensive to create, especially if they involve complex setup or connections. The Object Pool pattern is like the toolbox â€“ it manages a collection of pre-created objects that you can "borrow" and "return," saving the cost of constant creation and destruction.
Benefits

Performance boost: You avoid the overhead of creating new objects repeatedly. This is particularly useful for things like database connections, network sockets, or large graphical elements.
Resource management: You can control the maximum number of objects in the pool, preventing your application from consuming excessive memory or resources.
